### About This Portfolio

Welcome to my **AWS Cloud Portfolio** — a collection of practical projects, labs, and certifications that showcase my journey in **cloud computing**.  
This repository highlights my **hands-on experience** with AWS technologies, **cloud infrastructure**, and **real-world problem solving**.

I am passionate about learning how cloud systems work and applying that knowledge to design secure, efficient, and scalable solutions.

### Core Skills Demonstrated

- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure** — creating and managing virtual servers, storage, and networking on AWS  
- ⚙️ **Compute & Networking Services** — EC2, VPCs, Load Balancing, and Elastic IPs  
- 🔐 **Security & Databases** — IAM roles, encryption, and RDS fundamentals  
- 💻 **Hands-On Labs & Projects** — real AWS deployments and troubleshooting exercises  

This portfolio will continue to grow as I expand my expertise in cloud solutions and complete more projects.
